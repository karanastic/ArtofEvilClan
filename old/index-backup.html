											<h4>RickRox and RickGutz</h4>
<p> Our fearless leader. Sort of like Nick Fury. RickRox started the clan with a vision to make the world a better place. He gathered the very best players in the world to make an Avengers-esque Clash of Clans team. </p>

										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/members/smee.jpg" alt="Smee" title="Smee"  /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>SMEE</h4>
											<p>Not all gingers have no soul. This guy proves it! Another North County San Diego member. One of the original founding fathers of the clan. He is often the voice of reason within the clan. He frequently gazes at a life size PEKKA poster hanging in his bedroom, wondering what she looks like without all that armor. </p>

										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/members/jacko2.jpg" alt="Jacko" title="Jacko"  /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Jacko</h4>
											<p>This sometimes controversial member always has something outlandish to say! He's as funny as he is dedicated to the game. Has been known to slap Exodur around like an abused puppy from time to time. </p>
										</div>
									</article>
									
									<article>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/members/exodur.jpg" alt="Exodur" title="Exodur" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Exodur</h4>
											<p>Living in Austin Texas, Exo likes video gaming, survival skills training and working on his businesses.  Side hobbies include making fun of Jacko, visiting Jacko's mum, reminding Jacko that he plays CoC better than him and long walks on the beach...with Jacko's Missus. </p>

									<article>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/members/wraith.jpg" alt="Wraith" title="Wraith"  /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Wraith and Chaos</h4>
<p> Another member with more identies than Batman. Wraith enjoys cutting people with his pocketknife and sniffing gasoline when he's not playing the game. This causes him to breath fire into open wounds and cauterize them on occasion.</p>

								<article>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/members/docg.jpg" alt="Doc G" title="Doc G"  /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Doc G</h4>
<p>Doc G has spent more money in the game than most people in third worlds will make in their entire family's history. He is credited as having paid for the college tuitions of several of SuperCell's board members daughters (pictured). </p>

										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/members/asiangamer1.jpg" alt="AsianGamer1" title="AsianGamer1"  /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>AsianGamer1</h4>
<p> Not much can be said about AsianGamer1 that hasn't already been implied by his username. He's a sexy Asian man who loves to game. It is unknown what the number 1 stands for or why it was added. No one cares enough to ask. 
Lastly, AG1 has poor eyesight, possibly due due to Myopia or Hypermetropia. Even with this ailment, he has managed to overcome obstacles and break barriers to become a wallbreaker master.</p>

										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/members/arken.jpg" alt="Arken" title="Arken"  /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>Arken</h4>
<p>By far the youngest member of the group who has yet to sip his first drop of booze. Arken is not to be confused with Arkham Asylum (happens all the time). The Co-Leaders took this 17 year old on as a Padawan, so that he could be molded into a furious beast that rapes and ravish his enemies. Arken is pictured here, hanging out with his pet human he calls Rufus.  </p>

								<article>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/members/mikeye.jpg" alt="MIKEYE" title="MIKEYE"  /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>MIKEYE</h4>
<p>Another member from <i>across the pond</i> who enjoys taking holiday which involve him and his mates dressing up as the cast of Downtown Abbey to re-enact the Christmas episodes. He cosplay's as Lady Edith because she is so feisty and takes gruff from nobody. Jacko would think this is because he is from Essex, the land of pretty boys and easy whores. I suppose Jacko would know. Regardless, this is a solid member who rocks the TH8 with pride.  </p>
