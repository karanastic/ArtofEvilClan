       	<h1>About Our Clan</h1>
    <p class="paddingtop20">    First off, let's set the record straight. We are a selective group of Clash of Clans enthusiasts, not a gang. We go to war constantly and cause mayhem on our opponents. This 18+ Clan takes the game seriously with a sense of humour.
</p>

<p>The clan originated in Oceanside, California in late 2013. It started out with one man with a dream and a dangerous dose of ambition, RickRox. He soon recruited Smee, Doc G, Beez, and the infamous Karanastic. One by one, more prospects and then members joined from around the globe. Each played a part in a larger role, each serving a purpose. As a result, the clan morphed into a dark brotherhood who mastered the Art of Evil.

<p class="lefttext">2. Use all attacks during war | Even if we are winning, all attacks should be used.</p>

<p class="lefttext">3. Attack your parallel first. (If you are ranked #8 in war, attack their #8 first)</p>

<p class="lefttext">4. If you have not attacked your parallel after 12 hours, another member can use their clean up attack on your parallel.</p>

<p class="lefttext">5. Communicate on chat and donate troops. If you communicate properly, rules 2-4 can be pardoned.</p>

<p class="lefttext">6. Opt-Out only if you have significant personal reason or your Spell Factory is upgrading and/or BOTH ROYALS are upgrading. Max 5 opt-outs per war. If more than 5, co-leaders will auto opt-in members based on highest trophy count.</p>

<p>New members are on a 30 day trial period. After that, they will be promoted to Elder. Failure to follow the rules will result in a demotion if Elder or higher, and a 2 week ban if you are a member.</div>
